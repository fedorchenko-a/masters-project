Prerequisites

	1.	Terraform installed on your local machine.
	2.	Ansible installed on your local machine.
	3.	AWS account with necessary permissions.
	4.	Basic understanding of Terraform and Ansible.

# Repository Setup
Clone your repository containing the Terraform and Ansible configurations and navigate into the directory:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

# Terraform Initialization
Initialize Terraform within the Terraform directory (terraform_aws for AWS or terraform_do for Digitalocean):
```bash
cd terraform_aws
terraform init
```

# Provision infrastructure with Terraform

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
Note the output IP address of the server from Terraformâ€™s output.

# Update Ansible Inventory
Edit the inventory.ini file to include the new server IP under the correct group:
```bash
[servers]
server ansible_host=server_ip ansible_user=ubuntu
```
# Configure Server with Ansible
```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yaml
```
# Github action configuration
Open Settings - Secrets and Variables - Actions
Create repository secrets:
```bash
SERVER_HOST
SERVER_PASS
SERVER_USER
```



# Github Actions
Deploy via Github actions will be triggered only if tag created.
Tests triggered on MR to master branch.
```bash
git tag -s 1.0.0 -m "LTI release for 1.0.0 deployment ver"
git push origin 1.0.0
```
